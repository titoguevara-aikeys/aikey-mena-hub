# Performance & Security Audit

This directory contains performance and security audit artifacts for the AI Assistant route.

## Performance Metrics

### Targets
- LCP ≤ 2.5s (Largest Contentful Paint)
- TTI ≤ 3s (Time to Interactive)
- CLS ≤ 0.1 (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- P95 interaction latency ≤ 200ms
- Route bundle ≤ 250KB gzipped

### Current Status
- ✅ Code splitting implemented for AI components
- ✅ React.memo and useCallback optimizations
- ✅ Debounced input handling (150ms)
- ✅ Web Worker for heavy operations
- ✅ Virtualized lists for large data sets
- ✅ Offline mocks to reduce network overhead

## Security Measures

### Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security)
- Cross-Origin policies

### Input Validation
- Zod schemas for all user inputs
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- CSRF token validation

### Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase RLS policies
- Secure cookie configuration
- Session management
- API key validation

## Running Audits

### Performance
```bash
npm run analyze              # Bundle analysis
npm run perf:lighthouse      # Lighthouse audit
npm run test:perf           # Performance testing
```

### Security
```bash
npm run audit:security      # npm security audit
npm run audit:deps         # Dependency check
npm run lint               # ESLint security rules
```
